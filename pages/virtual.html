        <h1 class="display-4 my-4">Virtualization</h1>

        <p>
            Virtualization is the creation of a virtual -- rather than actual -- version of something, such as an
            operating system (OS), a server, a storage device or network resources.

            Virtualization uses software that simulates hardware functionality in order to create a virtual system. This
            practice allows IT organizations to operate multiple operating systems, more than one virtual system and
            various applications on a single server. The benefits of virtualization include greater efficiencies and
            economies of scale.

            OS virtualization is the use of software to allow a piece of hardware to run multiple operating system
            images at the same time. The technology got its start on mainframes decades ago, allowing administrators to
            avoid wasting expensive processing power.

        <h1 class="my-5">How does it work?</h1>

        <p>
            Virtualization describes a technology in which an application, guest operating system (guest OS) or data
            storage is abstracted away from the true underlying hardware or software. A key use of virtualization
            technology is server virtualization, which uses a software layer -- called a hypervisor -- to emulate the
            underlying hardware. This often includes the CPU's memory, input/output (I/O) and network traffic.
            Hypervisors take the physical resources and separate them so they can be utilized by the virtual
            environment. They are able to sit on top of an OS or they can be directly installed onto the hardware. The
            latter is how most enterprises virtualize their systems.
