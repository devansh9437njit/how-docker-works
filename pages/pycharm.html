        <h1 class="display-4 my-4">Connect Docker with Pycharm</h1>

        <p>
            In Python, when you run an application – a Django site, a database script, etc. – you are running it in an
            environment. Python has some tools to manage the environment and make it reproducible, such as virtual
            environments, pip requirements.txt files, and setup.py dependencies. But what about the non-Python parts of
            application?
        </p>

        <p>Containers are one solution to this. In Docker, a container is an isolated universe with software, running
            inside your computer. They are fast and easy to create, start, stop, and destroy. This is ideal, not just
            for development, but for deployment as well.</p>
        <p>

        <p>
            PyCharm 5 provides the beginning of a series of steps towards productive development using containers and
            Docker. Namely, PyCharm 5 supports project interpreters that are executed in a Docker container.
        </p>

        <h1>Preparation</h1>
        <p>
            First, make sure docker and docker-machine are setup in your environment. The Docker installation is
            painless and the website docs are quite friendly. You’ll need a Docker “host” virtual machine setup and
            running, including on Linux. On Windows and OS X, installing the Docker Toolbox is effortless.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we have to decide what software we want in our containers. In Docker, containers are built using
            “images”: collections of pre-installed software plus configuration that is called during container creation.
            Unlike other interpreters in PyCharm, you don’t visit the Project Interpreter preferences to add Python
            packages. All dependencies need to be baked into the Docker image you choose.
        </p>

        <p>
            This blog post is based on the “minimum/docker-django-mysite“ Docker image, which includes enough
            Python/Django software to run the PyCharm-generated Django starter project. You can fetch that onto your
            system with this command:
        </p>

        <strong>docker pull minimum/docker-django-mysite
        </strong>

        <p>
            Once that Docker image is locally available and the Docker “host” is running and knows about it, PyCharm can
            make Docker interpreters for your project, as containers based on that image.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alternatively, you can skip this step and later pull in the image while creating the Docker-based remote
            interpreter by simply typing in the image name during creation.
        </p>

        <h1>Create Django Project</h1>

        <p>
            Let’s make a Django project, then make a Docker interpreter for it. In PyCharm, choose File -> New Project,
            click on Django, and follow the normal process for making a Django project.
            <br>
            During project creation, you’ll have to use a local interpreter. If you try to make a Docker interpreter,
            PyCharm will give a warning saying you can only use a local interpreter.
            <br>
            The result of this step is a directory on your local computer with sample Django code and a Django-specific
            PyCharm Run Configuration.
        </p>

        <h1>
            Make PyCharm Docker Interpreter
        </h1>

        <p>
            On to the important part. We need to define a “remote interpreter” that runs in a PyCharm Docker container.
            <br>
            First, go to Preferences -> Project Interpreter and click on the gear to the right of Project Interpreter
            near the top. In the Configure Remote Python Interpreterdialog, click the Docker button.
            <br>
            Click the menu dropdown for Machine Name. It will likely have one entry named default. Choose that, and you
            will see the following:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/img7.png" width="800px" alt="">

        <p>
            know which images are available locally. Hence the dropdown for Images. Click on the dropdown and choose
            minimum/docker-django-mysite:latest as the image, then click Ok.
            <br>
            You now have a Docker container that will be used as your project interpreter. PyCharm features like
            autocompletion, code inspections, and checks will be driven by this interpreter.
        </p>

        <h1>Run Django</h1>

        <p>
            Now that we have a Docker container for our project interpreter, let’s use our Django-flavored Run
            Configuration to run it. Just to be safe, edit the run configuration to make sure it is using the
            Docker-oriented interpreter.
            <br>
            What does PyCharm do when it runs this configuration:
            <br>
            First, it creates and starts a new container based on the image we named when creating the project
            interpreter.<br>
            This container mounts your project directory into the container at /opt/project in the container. Note: On
            Linux, you currently have to perform this volume mapping manually.
            This container also mounts volumes needed for PyCharm to do its work: Python skeletons and Python library
            sources.<br>
            It then executes the run configuration’s Python command.
            If you are running PyCharm 5.0.2 or older, there is one fix you need to do:
            <br>
            Run -> Edit Configurations and select the PyCharm-generated Djano run configuration
            In the Host field, enter 0.0.0.0
            When you click the “Run” button, Django will be started. Yay, we are running a container! In fact, we can go
            on to test running, debugging, code coverage, profiling, and all the other ways to run a configuration. But
            first, let’s click the link in the console to open the Django site in our browser:
