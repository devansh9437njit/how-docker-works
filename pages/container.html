        <p>
            Containerisation of software is a key technology trend and a shift that has happened in recent years. It
            involves packaging software as a container in order to ensure that it runs uniformly and consistently on any
            infrastructure. A container is an independent and standard unit of an application that packages the
            application code and all its dependencies like libraries, components, run-time settings into an executable
            image that can run in the same manner on diverse environments. This helps developers to be agnostic of the
            target infrastructure on which their applications will run and at the same time, the operations team can be
            free from the worries of getting the dependencies set up properly for working software.

            DevOps is made up of two terms Dev and Ops. Dev means Development and Ops means operations. When you combine
            Development and Operations it becomes DevOps, so it is a combination of software development and operations
            in information technology that makes it businesses much easier to deliver applications at a very fast rate.
            Basically, DevOps brings development and operations teams together so that there are very few complexities
            in software development. DevOps is a mindset, a way of working for an organization so that new features
            reach the users as quickly as possible and smoothly too. DevOps has become a new standard in the product
            development field, especially in cloud computing. Cloud computing has made things easy between development
            and deployment. There are few DevOps tools like Docker, Ansible, Git, Puppet, Chef, Jenkins, Nagios, Splunk,
            etc, which play a huge role, and the DevOps process consists of 8 stages: plan, code, build, test, release,
            deploy, operate and monitor. You can check out the below video from Wiculty to know more.
